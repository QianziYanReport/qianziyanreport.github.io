<p>A semester ends, I feel time runs so fast. When I look back I found that I do learn a lot from the course, this course means a lot. I still remember that in the first class, we did a survey to evaluate our level of C++. I chose D because I think my level is not so good and I know that this course will help me improve my skills.</p>

<p>We started from learning points and references. This is the first challenge for me. I’m a little confused from that. In declaration or in expression, ‘*’ and ‘&amp;’ have different meaning. But I understand them quickly and can use them correctly in my code. I know this knowledge may be useful in the future work or job interview.</p>

<a id="markovian-tweets" class="anchor" href="#markovian-tweets" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Markovian-tweets</h3>

<p>Then the first project came: Markovian-tweets. Actually, I never heard this thing before. So after seeing first project, I search a lot online and discussed with my friends a lot to figure out what is Markovian text. It is a text generator using probability. It will analyse which word will most probably come after a word. Using this, then a text will be generated. I found my teammates and then we started. We divided our work, my work is level 1does the base Markov Sentence Generation from the sample text and his is level 2 and 3. It costs me about a week to do the project.<br>
My code generally has three functions: Firstly, it can read a text, then secondly analysing it by using markov chain. Finally, it will generate a random text based on the origin text. Combining with my teammates code, we can get someone’s tweet from website then generate a new one based on the original one. When I tried it in the class, I found it very interesting and I’m proud of my work. </p>

<a id="first-red-team-project" class="anchor" href="#first-red-team-project" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First Red Team Project</h3>

<p>After finishing project, we become a red team which means we will read another team’s code and find if there any weakness or unsuitable code. It is very interesting and fresh to me. I never do this before. Before reading their code, I read rules on the web. There are so many rules, and I didn’t even see them before. I spend some days read and learn. I feel that they are very useful and helpful. For example, we will use a lot of char, int and strings which means Rule STR and INT will be used frequently and important. I read another team’s code and find some places they use the rule to protect their code and then I alter the code to make it weaker.</p>

<a id="minesweeper-a-funny-game" class="anchor" href="#minesweeper-a-funny-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Minesweeper: A Funny Game</h3>

<p>The second project is interesting, it is Minesweeper, a game I often play in the laptop. I never thought I will develop it by myself. But when I heard I will do this I think it will be fun. I spend a day playing the game to understand how it work. Then I started to do this.
I use several functions to do this game. For example, PutMines to generate mines randomly in a 10<em>10 square pixels. GenerateNumofMine generate numbers around mine. ShowStyle to form a interface to the gamer etc. But I know my code still has some problems. Gamer can just play in a 10</em>10 square, they can not change size. In a ask interface, they need to input ’y’ or ’n’, but if they input other things the code will crash. All of these should be optimized later.</p>

<a id="randdo-not-use-it" class="anchor" href="#randdo-not-use-it" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rand():Do Not Use It</h3>

<p>After the minesweeper, a very important point come to class. It is rand(). In class we found that it is not good to use rand() in the code, because. It uses a variation of a Linear Congruential Generator to produce the random numbers from the seed. I realized that I should avoid use rand() in future programming. Then I learn some ways to substitute rand(). For example, /dev/urandom , /dev/random or salsa20.
Second Red Team Project
By learning from class, I know that rand() is not good and in the next red team project I found that many of us used rand(). This red team project also need read another team’s code. But rules we need to check are only MSC and DCL. I found some good points, they define the class cell in a head file. Using a header file to introduce the object into both translation units is a proper application to avoid some mistake. I also find some weakness, rand() is one of them.</p>

<p>The next point I learned a lot is hash. I think it has a lot practical use, because may website need to input password, and these passwords cannot be a plaintext. So hash may be used.</p>

<a id="gee-mail-a-challenge" class="anchor" href="#gee-mail-a-challenge" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gee-mail: A Challenge</h3>

<p>The final project is Gee-mail. To be honest, I think it is definitely the most difficult project in the class. It combines many points I learned in the class: salsa20, hash, sqlite3, Hexadecimal exchange with integer, encrypt and decrypt etc. It is a big challenge for me.
My teammate and I spend a whole night discussing how to do it. We draw the diagram of Gee-mail and analyse how to do each part. My work is design the table mails in the database, write some functions like hex2str, hex2int, int2hex, str2hex, write the send main interface and some other things. Finally, with our effort we made it.</p>

<p>This semester comes to the end and so the course does, I need to say I did learn a lot from this course. All these knowledges will be helpful for my future job. All projects I did in this class will also help me when I have job interviews. By this course, I improved my C++ skill and got many secure software knowledge. This course means a lot for me.</p>
